## ✅ Verification Checklist

Before adding any shop to the target list, verify these criteria:

### ⚠️ Critical Exclusions

**DO NOT INCLUDE:**

1. **Crystal/Stone-Only Shops**
   - Example: Shop that ONLY sells crystals, stones, minerals

   - ❌ **Excluded:** Crystal Way (only crystals)

2. **Candle-Only Shops**
   - Example: Shop that ONLY sells candles

3. **Shops Without Food Permits** (where required)
   - Example: SF Zen Center Bookstore (no food permit)
   - Example: The Sword and Rose (no food permit)
   - Why: Cannot legally sell food/beverage products
   - ✅ **Include if:** They have proper food permit OR product is sold as non-food item (e.g., ceremonial supplies)

### Verification Steps

## 💰 Sales Process & Pricing

### **Key Insight: The Real Barrier is Pricing, Not Venue Fit**

Based on actual sales conversations:
- **Venue fit is good** - Shops are interested in the product
- **Sales process is the issue** - Consignment vs. purchase, markup requirements

### Actual Sales Outcomes

**East West Bookshop (Mountain View)**
- **Status:** ❌ Rejected
- **Reason:** Doesn't like consignment + needs 100% markup
- **Insight:** Issue is pricing structure, not venue fit
- **Action Needed:** 
  - Offer outright purchase option
  - Calculate wholesale price that allows 100% markup
  - If retail target is $12, wholesale must be ≤ $6

**Love of Ganesha (San Francisco)**
- **Status:** ✅ Accepted
- **Method:** Outright purchase (no consignment)
- **Insight:** Some shops prefer buying outright
- **Action:** Successful model to replicate

### Consignment vs. Outright Purchase

**Option 1: Consignment**
- **Pros:** Lower risk for shop, no upfront cash from them
- **Cons:** Shop may want higher margins, you hold inventory risk
- **When to use:** New relationships, test market

**Option 2: Outright Purchase**
- **Pros:** Cash upfront, shop committed to selling
- **Cons:** Shop takes inventory risk
- **When to use:** Established relationships, proven demand
- **Example:** Love of Ganesha accepted this

**Recommendation:** Offer both options - start with whichever shop prefers

### Markup Requirements

**100% Markup Formula:**
- Shop sells at: $12
- Shop needs to buy at: $6 (allows 100% markup)
- Your cost must allow profit at $6 wholesale

**50% Markup Formula:**
- Shop sells at: $12
- Shop needs to buy at: $8 (allows 50% markup)
- More room for your margin

**Calculation:**
```
Retail Price = Wholesale Price × (1 + Markup %)

Example (100% markup):
$12 = Wholesale × 2
Wholesale = $6
```

### Sales Approach Template

**Initial Contact Script:**

1. **Introduce Product:**
   - "We offer 100% ceremonial cacao, regenerative farming, direct from Brazilian farmers"

2. **Offer Options:**
   - "We can work with consignment or outright purchase - whichever you prefer"

3. **Ask About Markup:**
   - "What markup do you typically need? We can structure pricing to accommodate"

4. **Calculate Pricing:**
   - If they need 100% markup: Wholesale = Retail ÷ 2
   - If they need 50% markup: Wholesale = Retail ÷ 1.5

5. **Be Flexible:**
   - Adjust pricing structure based on their needs
   - Consider volume discounts for outright purchase

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue 1: Consignment Rejection**
- **Solution:** Offer outright purchase as alternative

**Issue 2: Markup Requirements Too High**
- **Solution:** 
  - Calculate if your costs allow required markup
  - Consider volume pricing
  - Evaluate if retail price can be adjusted

**Issue 3: Pricing Structure**
- **Solution:**
  - Be transparent about pricing
  - Show how markup works
  - Offer flexible terms

### Success Factors

2. **Transparency:** Clear pricing structure
3. **Calculation:** Know your costs and margins
4. **Adaptation:** Adjust based on shop needs

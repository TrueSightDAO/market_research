# Email Outreach Strategy
## Complete Guide for Partner Store Email Outreach

Email outreach is a powerful complement to in-person visits. Use it to reach stores before visits, follow up after visits, and connect with stores you can't visit in person.

---

## 🎯 When to Use Email Outreach

### **Best Use Cases:**

1. **Pre-Visit Warm-Up** (Recommended)
   - Email stores 1-2 weeks before your visit
   - Introduce yourself and product
   - Offer to schedule a meeting when you're in town
   - **Benefit:** Higher success rate for in-person visits

2. **Post-Visit Follow-Up** (Critical)
   - Send within 24 hours of visit
   - Thank them, recap conversation
   - Provide requested materials
   - **Benefit:** Maintains momentum, shows professionalism

3. **Distant Stores** (High ROI)
   - Stores too far for in-person visit
   - Out-of-state opportunities
   - **Benefit:** Expands reach without travel costs

4. **Re-Engagement**
   - Stores that said "maybe later"
   - Follow-up after 3-6 months
   - **Benefit:** Reopens conversations

5. **Referral Follow-Up**
   - When stores refer you to others
   - Mention the referral source
   - **Benefit:** Higher response rate with warm intro

### **When NOT to Use Email:**

- ❌ First contact for local stores (in-person is better)
- ❌ If they explicitly said "no email"
- ❌ Mass blast without personalization
- ❌ Reaching out too frequently (spam territory)

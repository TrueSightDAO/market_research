## 💰 Pricing (Critical!)

**Ask First:**
"What markup do you typically need?"

**Offer Both:**
1. **Consignment** - Pay when items sell
2. **Purchase** - Buy wholesale, set retail price

**Calculate Together:**
- 100% markup: Retail $12 → Wholesale $6
- 50% markup: Retail $12 → Wholesale $8
- **Be flexible** - Show the math

**If They Say:**
- "Too expensive" → Work backwards from their retail price
- "Don't like consignment" → Offer purchase (like Love of Ganesha)
- "Need to think" → Leave materials, ask follow-up date

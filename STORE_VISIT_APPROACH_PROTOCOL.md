## 🚪 Entering the Store

### Step 1: Initial Entry (First 30 seconds)

**Body Language:**
- ✅ Confident, friendly demeanor
- ✅ Make eye contact with staff
- ✅ Smile naturally
- ✅ Don't rush - take in the store atmosphere

**What to Do:**
1. **Enter naturally** - browse for 30-60 seconds
2. **Observe the space** - products, vibe, customer flow
3. **Identify the decision-maker** - owner, manager, or staff member
4. **Look for product placement opportunities** - where would cacao fit?

**What NOT to Do:**
- ❌ Don't immediately ask for the owner
- ❌ Don't pull out samples immediately
- ❌ Don't interrupt staff helping customers

---

## 💬 Opening Approach (The First 2 Minutes)

### Option A: Natural Conversation Start (Recommended)

**When staff greets you:**
```
Staff: "Hi, can I help you find something?"
You: "Hi! I'm actually here to learn about your store. I love the [crystals/wellness/books] 
     you have. Do you have a moment to talk about a potential product partnership?"
```

**If browsing:**
```
You (to staff): "Hi, I'm [Name] from Agroverse. We make ceremonial cacao from regenerative 
               farms in Brazil. I'm wondering if you might be interested in carrying our 
               products. Is the owner or manager available?"
```

### Option B: Direct Approach (If store is quiet)

```
You: "Hi, I'm [Name] from Agroverse. We source ceremonial cacao directly from regenerative 
     farms in Brazil. I'd love to show you what we have and see if it might be a good fit 
     for your store. Is there a good time to talk?"
```

### Key Principles:
- **Be respectful of their time** - "Do you have a moment?"
- **Show genuine interest** - Compliment their store
- **State your purpose clearly** - Product partnership
- **Be flexible** - If they're busy, offer to come back

---

## 🎤 The Pitch (2-5 minutes)

### Core Message Structure

#### 1. **Introduction (30 seconds)**
```
"Hi, I'm [Name] from Agroverse. We make 100% ceremonial cacao sourced directly from 
regenerative farms in Brazil. We work directly with farmers like Oscar, Paulo, and Vivi 
to support regenerative agriculture and community."
```

#### 2. **Why It Fits Their Store (30-60 seconds)**
**For Spiritual/Metaphysical Shops:**
```
"I noticed you have [crystals/herbs/wellness items]. Ceremonial cacao fits perfectly with 
your community because it's used in sacred circles, intention-setting, and group rituals. 
It's a life-force enhancer that complements your spiritual tools."
```

**For Wellness Centers:**
```
"Your focus on [yoga/breathwork/healing] aligns with ceremonial cacao's use in wellness 
practices. It's a heart-opening, ceremonial-grade product that supports transformation 
and connection."
```

**For Boutique Chocolatiers:**
```
"As a boutique that values ethical sourcing, you'll appreciate that we work directly with 
farmers, use regenerative farming practices, and plant trees with every purchase. It's 
100% cacao - no additives, single-origin from Brazil."
```

#### 3. **Show Product (1-2 minutes)**
- Show product sample (if you brought one)
- Show photos on phone (packaging, farm, process)
- Explain the product: "100% ceremonial cacao, ground from whole beans, regenerative farming"

#### 4. **Values Alignment (30 seconds)**
```
"What makes us unique is our direct farmer relationships and regenerative practices. 
We plant trees with every purchase, support Amazon rainforest regeneration, and work 
with farmers who practice regenerative agriculture."
```

### Listen for Their Response

**Watch for:**
- Interest level (are they asking questions?)
- Concerns (pricing? fit? logistics?)
- Decision-making process (do they need to think? consult partner?)
- Timing (when do they make buying decisions?)

---

## 💰 Pricing Discussion (Critical Section)

### When They Ask About Pricing

#### Step 1: Ask About Their Needs First
```
"What markup do you typically need? We can structure pricing to accommodate your 
requirements."
```

#### Step 2: Offer Both Options
```
"We offer two options:
1. **Consignment** - You pay when items sell, no upfront cost
2. **Outright Purchase** - You buy wholesale, set your own retail price"
```

#### Step 3: Calculate Together (If They Need Specific Markup)

**If they need 100% markup:**
```
"If you want to retail at $12, and you need 100% markup, that means:
- Retail: $12
- Wholesale: $6 (you double your money)
- Our cost allows for this structure"
```

**If they need 50% markup:**
```
"If you want to retail at $12, and you need 50% markup, that means:
- Retail: $12
- Wholesale: $8 (you add 50% margin)
- More room in the pricing structure"
```

**Use your calculator** - Show them the math transparently

#### Step 4: Be Flexible
```
"We're flexible on pricing structure. What works best for your business model?"
```

### Common Pricing Objections & Responses

**Objection: "Your wholesale price is too high"**
- Response: "What retail price are you comfortable with? Let's work backwards from that."
- Calculate: Show them different markup scenarios
- Offer: Volume discounts for larger orders

**Objection: "I don't like consignment"**
- Response: "No problem - we can do outright purchase. What quantity would you want to start with?"
- Reference: "Love of Ganesha in SF prefers purchase too - it works great for them."

**Objection: "I need to think about it"**
- Response: "Absolutely - here's my card and product info. When would be a good time to follow up?"
- Leave materials: Product sheet, pricing, contact info

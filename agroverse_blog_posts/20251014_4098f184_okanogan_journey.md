## When Logistics Become the Story

Getting Brazilian regenerative cacao to customers in the USA isn't as simple as ordering from a distributor. When you prioritize direct relationships with family farms in Pará and Bahia, you also take on the logistics challenges that most consumers never see.

This is the story of how cacao travels from Oscar's family farm in Bahia—where his grandfather planted trees 80 years ago—to customers in the United States. It involves postal service rejections, USA tariff regulations, and yes, someone crossing international borders with 10 bags of cacao in a backpack.

## Oscar's Farm: Where the Journey Begins

Oscar's family has been growing cacao in Bahia, Brazil for three generations. The trees his grandfather planted 80 years ago are still producing today—a testament to both the longevity of well-tended cacao trees and the multi-generational commitment required for regenerative farming.

### What Makes This Cacao Different?

When you walk through Oscar's farm, you're not walking through a plantation. You're walking through what looks like a forest—cacao trees integrated with native species, creating a biodiverse ecosystem rather than a monoculture.

**This is regenerative agriculture in action:**
- Cacao trees growing under the canopy of taller native trees
- Natural pest control through biodiversity
- Soil health building over decades
- Multi-generational knowledge passed down through the family

Oscar's 80-year-old trees represent a different farming philosophy: plant once, tend for generations, pass living trees to your children and grandchildren. These aren't trees planted for a 15-year productivity cycle—these are trees planted for a century.

## The Processing Journey: From Farm to Product

After harvest at Oscar's farm, the cacao goes through careful processing:

**At the Farm:**
- Hand-selected pods from specific trees
- Traditional fermentation methods (passed down through generations)
- Sun-drying on raised beds
- Quality checks at every stage

**At the Santos Processing Facility:**
- Temperature-controlled roasting to preserve beneficial compounds
- Specialized winnowing and cracking
- Grinding (18-24 hours for ceremonial cacao paste)
- Hand-poured bars with complete traceability

Every batch can be traced back to specific farms. This level of traceability is what we mean by "direct relationships"—we're not buying from commodity brokers, we're working directly with families like Oscar's.

## When Matheus Hit the Wall at Correios

Here's where the logistics challenge begins.

Matheus, part of our team in Brazil, walked into Correios (Brazil's postal service) in São Paulo with carefully packaged boxes of processed cacao products. All documentation in order. Ready to ship to customers in the United States.

The clerk looked at the package, looked at the computer, and said: "I can't accept this."

"Why not?"

"USA tariffs and UPU suspesion on Brazilian merchanises. It will be blocked at customs."

*[Video: Matheus at Correios attempting to ship]*

Matheus tried explaining. None of it mattered. The bureaucratic wall was absolute.

### The Reality of Small-Scale Sourcing

This is what consumers rarely see. Large chocolate corporations have:
- Established import channels
- Legal teams on retainer  
- Customs brokers
- Infrastructure built over decades

Small-scale regenerative producers working with family farms? We get blocked at the postal counter.

The cacao sat in Brazil. We had customers waiting in the United States. The conventional supply chain had just failed.

## Gary's Solution: When You Become the Logistics

When postal routes get blocked by regulations, you have to get creative—and remain completely legal.

Gary looked at the situation and made a decision: if the postal service won't deliver it, I'll carry it across the border myself.

**The Plan:**
- Fly from São Paulo through Columbia, El Salvador
- Carry 10 bags of premium Brazilian cacao
- Declare everything at customs along with FDA prior notice
- Find out if manual border crossing is a viable pathway while postal routes are blocked

**The Reality:**

Gary loaded 10 bags of cacao into his backpack. The weight came in at 16 kilograms in total. Perfect! Unfortunately he already had alot of stuff in his backpack and wasn't expecting he needed to do this during this trip. He would have packed less bulky items in his backpack otherwise.

*[Video: Gary loading bags into backpack]*

At the USA border, the customs official looked at the declaration form.

"You're carrying how much cacao?"

"Ten bags. All declared. Here's the documentation."

The official examined the paperwork. Everything was legitimate: processed products and proper documentation. Gary wasn't smuggling—he was testing whether manual import with full transparency could work when postal routes fail.

**The result?** 

Successful crossing. Zero tariffs. Complete transparency worked.

### Why This Matters

This wasn't just about getting one shipment across. Gary's manual crossing was a test case: **Can small-scale regenerative producers still reach USA markets when traditional postal routes get blocked by regulations?**

Answer: Yes, but it requires someone willing to literally carry the weight.

Big corporations have import infrastructure. Small farmers have people like Gary figuring it out, one backpack at a time.

## The Bigger Picture: Why We Do This

You might be wondering: wouldn't it be easier to just source from established importers? Work through existing supply chains? Avoid all these logistics headaches?

Yes. It would be much easier.

But here's what we'd lose:

### 1. **Direct Relationships with Farming Families**

Working directly with Oscar means:
- He earns 30-100% above conventional cacao prices (depending on quality)
- We can verify regenerative practices firsthand
- We know exactly which trees our cacao comes from
- Multi-generational farming becomes economically viable

When you buy from commodity brokers, you have no idea if farmers like Oscar can afford to keep farming regeneratively. With direct relationships, we know.

### 2. **Complete Traceability**

Every batch of our cacao can be traced to:
- Specific farms (GPS coordinates available)
- Specific farming families
- Specific growing practices
- Specific harvest dates

You're not buying "Brazilian cacao." You're buying cacao from Oscar's 80-year-old trees in Bahia—trees his grandfather planted, that his children harvest from today.

### 3. **Support for Regenerative Practices**

Oscar's agroforestry system:
- Integrates cacao with native forest species
- Builds soil health over decades
- Creates habitat for wildlife
- Sequesters carbon in both trees and soil

This only works economically if farmers earn enough to maintain these practices. Direct relationships with premium pricing make regenerative farming viable.

### 4. **Preservation of Multi-Generational Knowledge**

Oscar learned from his father, who learned from his grandfather. This knowledge—how to read the trees, when to harvest, how to ferment for specific flavor profiles—only survives if young people see farming as a viable future.

When Oscar earns fair compensation, his children consider continuing the family tradition. When he earns commodity prices, they move to cities.

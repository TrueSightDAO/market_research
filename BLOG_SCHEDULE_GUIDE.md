# 📝 Blog Content Schedule Management Guide

## 🎯 Overview
This system manages your blog publishing schedule in sync with your Instagram content strategy, creating a cohesive multi-channel content marketing approach.

## 🔗 Integration with Instagram
**Key Principle**: Blog posts should support and expand on Instagram themes, creating a content ecosystem where each channel amplifies the other.

### Recommended Flow:
1. **Instagram teases** the topic with bite-sized content
2. **Blog provides** deep educational content  
3. **Instagram CTAs** drive traffic to blog
4. **Blog CTAs** drive to product pages/email signup

## 📁 Key Files
- **CSV File**: `blog_schedule.csv`
- **Google Sheet**: Same spreadsheet as Instagram, worksheet: "Blog Content Schedule"
- **Sync Script**: `sync_blog_schedule.py`
- **Template**: `blog_schedule_template.csv` (reference example)

## 🔑 Primary Key System
Primary keys are generated using: `Publish Date + Blog Title`

**Example:**
- `"20260113" + "The Ultimate Guide to Criollo Cacao..."` = `4949370d`

**Important**: If you change Publish Date or Blog Title, the primary key changes, and status preservation fails for that row.

## 🎯 SEO Best Practices

### Keyword Research:
1. Use Google Keyword Planner, Ahrefs, or SEMrush
2. Target 1 primary keyword + 3-5 secondary keywords per post
3. Include long-tail keywords (e.g., "what is criollo cacao")

### On-Page SEO Checklist:
- ✅ Primary keyword in title (front-loaded)
- ✅ Primary keyword in first paragraph
- ✅ Keywords in H2/H3 headings naturally
- ✅ Alt text for all images
- ✅ Internal links to 3-5 related posts
- ✅ External links to authoritative sources
- ✅ Meta description (150-160 characters)
- ✅ URL slug includes primary keyword

### Technical SEO:
- Use Yoast SEO or Rank Math plugin
- Enable schema markup for articles
- Compress images (WebP format)
- Fast page load times (<3 seconds)

## 📈 Content Repurposing Strategy

### One Blog Post Can Become:
1. **4-6 Instagram posts** (carousels, reels, single images)
2. **Email newsletter** (excerpt + CTA to full post)
3. **Pinterest pins** (5-10 different designs)
4. **YouTube video script** (future expansion)
5. **Podcast episode topic** (future expansion)
6. **Twitter/X thread** (key points + link)

### Example Repurposing:
```
Blog: "Ultimate Guide to Criollo Cacao" (1,800 words)
    ↓
Instagram: 4-post series (Week 17)
    ↓  
Newsletter: "This Week: Discover Criollo Cacao"
    ↓
Pinterest: 10 pins with different quotes/facts
    ↓
Facebook: Long-form post with blog link
```

## 🚨 Critical Rules

1. **NEVER change Publish Date or Title** after scheduling unless absolutely necessary (breaks primary key)
2. **ALWAYS align blog themes with Instagram** for maximum cross-promotion
3. **Publish blog BEFORE Instagram series starts** so CTAs can drive traffic
4. **Include Instagram embeds in blog** to create circular traffic flow
5. **Update Instagram bio link** when new blog publishes
6. **Track performance** in Google Analytics and adjust strategy

## 📊 Success Metrics to Track

### Blog Analytics:
- Page views per post
- Average time on page (target: >3 minutes)
- Bounce rate (target: <60%)
- Social shares
- Comments/engagement
- Conversion rate (blog → shop)

### Cross-Channel Metrics:
- Instagram → Blog traffic (UTM tracking)
- Blog → Instagram followers
- Blog → Product page clicks
- Email signups from blog
- Overall brand search volume

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Status not preserved"
- **Cause**: Publish Date or Title changed
- **Solution**: Check if these fields were modified
- **Prevention**: Finalize title before first sync

### "Sync script fails"
- **Cause**: Missing worksheet or credentials
- **Solution**: Ensure "Blog Content Schedule" worksheet exists in spreadsheet
- **Check**: google_credentials.json file has proper permissions

### "Blog and Instagram out of sync"
- **Cause**: Blog published after Instagram series started
- **Solution**: Publish blog first, then start Instagram promotion
- **Prevention**: Plan blog 1-2 days ahead of Instagram series

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Batch Write**: Write 4 blog posts in one day, schedule throughout month
2. **Templates**: Create reusable templates for common post types
3. **Research Once**: One deep research session → multiple content pieces
4. **Evergreen Focus**: 80% evergreen content, 20% timely/seasonal
5. **Update Old Posts**: Refresh high-performing posts annually for SEO
6. **Guest Posts**: Occasionally feature farmer stories or expert interviews

## 📞 When to Ask for Help

- When planning quarterly content themes
- When blog and Instagram strategies seem misaligned

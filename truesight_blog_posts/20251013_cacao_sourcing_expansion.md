## üí° What This Activity Means

### Transparent Contribution Tracking

Every activity mentioned above was logged in our [Telegram channels](https://t.me/truesightdao) and automatically tracked through Edgar, our AI contribution bot ([@truesight_tdg_bot](https://t.me/truesight_tdg_bot)). Edgar monitors Telegram submissions from DAO members and records them in our [public ledger](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qbZZhf-_7xzmDTriaJVWj6OZshyQsFkdsAV8-pyzASQ). This transparency is core to TrueSight DAO's model:

1. **Members submit** work to DAO projects via Telegram
2. **Edgar (AI bot) logs** contributions automatically
3. **Governors review** and approve TDG token issuance
4. **Contributors earn** TDG tokens based on verified work

*Edgar isn't a human contributor‚Äîit's our AI system ensuring no contribution goes untracked.*

### Regenerative Supply Chain in Action

The heavy focus on cacao sourcing (26 activities) reflects our commitment to building direct relationships with regenerative farms. Unlike conventional supply chains where farmers are invisible, TrueSight DAO's model:

- **Knows every farm** by GPS coordinates
- **Tracks every partnership** discussion
- **Documents every visit** for community transparency
- **Rewards every contribution** to building these relationships

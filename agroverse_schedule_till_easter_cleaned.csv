This confusion trips up even chocolate lovers. Let's clear it up with what actually happens at our farms in Par√° & Bahia!

Here's the real difference between cacao and cocoa:
1Ô∏è‚É£ CACAO = minimally processed beans (fermented, dried, sometimes roasted)‚Äîretains 80-90% of natural nutrients and complex flavors
2Ô∏è‚É£ COCOA = heavily processed powder (alkalized, heated to high temps)‚Äîconvenient but loses most flavonoids and subtle taste notes
3Ô∏è‚É£ Our single-origin cacao tastes like the terroir it grew in‚ÄîBahia has nutty notes, Par√° more fruity‚Äîcocoa powder tastes mostly uniform

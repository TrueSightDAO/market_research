# ü§ù Manual Feedback Integration Workflow

## üéØ **Overview**

This workflow allows you to manually process community feedback and improve your content strategy through interactive collaboration with AI. The process is designed to be thoughtful and iterative rather than automated.

**Key Features:**
- **Event-based content creation** from community feedback
- **Cadence preservation** when inserting new content
- **Cross-theme integration** connecting diverse community experiences
- **Strategic content placement** maintaining chronological flow
- **Primary key management** ensuring consistency across systems

## üìã **Workflow Steps**

### **Step 1: Download Community Feedback**

```bash
# Download latest feedback from Google Sheets
python sync_feedback.py download
```

This creates `community_feedback.csv` with:
- Column A: Community feedback text
- Column B: Status (empty initially, "INCORPORATED" after processing)

**Types of Feedback to Process:**
- **Event information** - Community gatherings, dates, themes
- **Content suggestions** - Hashtag recommendations, theme ideas
- **Timing feedback** - Posting schedule preferences
- **Audience insights** - Community preferences and interests

### **Step 2: Review Feedback with AI**

```bash
# Analyze feedback and get AI suggestions
python process_feedback.py
```

This will:
- Analyze each piece of feedback
- Suggest improvements to content schedule
- Update CSV files with improvements
- Mark processed feedback as "INCORPORATED"
- **Event-based content creation** - Generate post-event content for community gatherings
- **Cross-theme connections** - Link event experiences to cacao farming narratives

### **Step 3: Manual Review & Refinement**

**Interactive Process with AI:**
1. **Review AI suggestions** - Discuss proposed changes
2. **Refine improvements** - Adjust based on your expertise
3. **Apply final changes** - Update CSV with agreed improvements
4. **Validate hashtag usage** - Ensure proper hashtag mix:
   - General hashtags: 3-5
   - Targeted hashtags: 7-10
5. **Check cadence preservation** - Ensure 4-post weekly structure maintained
6. **Consider date-specificity** - Determine if content can be shifted
7. **Plan content insertion** - Identify optimal placement for new content

### **Step 4: Sync Updates to Google Sheets**

```bash
# Sync improved content schedule
python sync_content_schedule.py

# Update feedback status in Google Sheets
python sync_feedback.py upload
```

**What Gets Synced:**
- **Content schedule updates** - New entries, improved hashtags, enhanced descriptions
- **Status updates** - Feedback marked as "INCORPORATED"
- **Primary key consistency** - Ensures CSV and Google Sheets stay synchronized
- **Chronological order** - Maintains Week 1-27 structure with proper date formatting

# TrueSight DAO Operational Framework: Agroverse Cacao Supply Chain Cadence for 2026

**Framework Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Prepared By:** TrueSight DAO Operations Team  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Purpose:** This framework outlines the phased operational cadence for Agroverse.shop, a TrueSight DAO initiative focused on regenerative cacao sourcing from Brazil to San Francisco production and sales. It integrates verifiable impact metrics, seasonal alignments, and expansion plans, including attendance at key U.S. chocolate and barter festivals for networking and B2C engagement. Designed for iterative refinement via TDG governance.

## Executive Summary

TrueSight DAO advances compassionate, transparent global change through initiatives like Agroverse.shop, which sources single-origin cacao annually from FDA-inspected farms in Brazil's Bahia and Pará regions (contributing to Brazil's 270,000-ton national output). The 2026 cadence features:
- **One consolidated April freight shipment** (early-month departure from Brazil; arrives SF mid-April) to minimize logistics costs.
- **Single 2-month Brazil immersion** (Jan 20–Mar 20) for sourcing and tree-planting (refer to agroverse.shop for actual milestone).
- **Phased focus**: Logistics (Jan–Mar), B2B production/outreach (Apr–Aug), B2C fulfillment (Sep–Dec).
- **Scalability**: Yielding 1-pound bars to wholesalers and 40-gram bars for retail; expanding from 5–10 to 20+ wholesale partners.
- **Key Events**: Attendance at Northwest Chocolate Festival (Oct 3–4, 2026, Bellevue, WA), Okanogan Autumn Barter Faire (Oct 16–18, 2026, Okanogan, WA), and Midwest Craft Chocolate Festival (Nov 20–21, 2026, Rushville, IN) for direct engagement.
- **Impact**: Supports our mission to restore 10,000 hectares amid 2.7 million acres burned in Brazil in 2025 (70% reduction from 2024), with regenerative practices enhancing soil health, CO2 sequestration, and bar nutrition (higher vitamins/minerals via shade-grown methods).

## Introduction

### DAO Context
TrueSight DAO leverages open-source governance and TDG tokens to drive verifiable, compassion-led initiatives. Agroverse exemplifies this: Direct trade bypasses middlemen for equitable farmer pricing, channeling profits into our mission to restore 10,000 hectares in the Amazon. Brazil's cacao sector faces challenges—27% deforestation uptick in early 2025—but regenerative agroforestry counters this, improving biodiversity and watershed conservation.

### Operational Model
- **Guild**: One overseer (remote coordination); SF community handles production; Brazilian community handles consolidation and logistics freighting.
- **Harvest Alignment**: Bahia (May–Sep flow post-Mar order); Pará (post-Jan flow).
- **Storage**: Cool/dry; viable up to 4 years.
- **Sales Dynamics**: 50% profits Oct–Dec; ~30 bars/month/store average; 60–100 bar reorders every 2–3 months (min. 20-bar threshold; 50% boutique markup). Cacao beans and cacao mass sold to wholesale partners (including manufacturers); 1-pound bars sold to wholesalers; 200 - 225grams bags and 40-gram retail bars direct to consumers or via boutique stores.40-gram retail bars direct to consumers or via boutique stores.
- **Growth Targets**: 20+ partners by year-end 2026; B2B outreach via email/calls.

## Phased Cadence

## Impact and Governance Recommendations

- **Environmental**: Contributes to Amazon reversal (1M+ hectares lost 2023); regenerative yields resilient farms.
- **Social/Economic**: Direct trade ensures fair pricing; DAO profits fund our mission to restore 10,000 hectares.
- **Governance**: TDG holders—propose via forum: Scale farms, tokenize metrics, or festival sponsorships.
- **Risks/Mitigations**: Price volatility (monthly tracking); storage (cool/dry protocols); Year 1 patterns (1–2 years to stabilize).

## Appendices
- **References**: Brazil cacao stats (web:5); Festival dates (web:6, web:0 for 2025 patterns, projected 2026).
- **Next Steps**: Q4 2025: Secure festival tickets; TDG vote on 2026 budget.
